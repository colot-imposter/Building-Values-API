## Problem Statement

---

During a disaster, it is important to model and estimate the potential or forecasted effect of the event, including the projected/forecasted damage.

Existing indicators of forecasted damage include number of structures within the affected area, number of people in the area, number of households, demographics of the impacted population, etc. This project will add an additional indicator: the value of the properties in the affected area.

## Conclusions

---

Our simple API may be utilized by a government agency, such as FEMA, to determine the range of property values within a given zip code and therefore how much aid may be required to repair damages to properties in the area. This property value data may be combined with many other factors in order to build a prediction model for the direct damages of a natural disaster in a given area. Other factors include but are not limited to the type and severity of the storm, types of industries in the area, and dynamics of the population demographics. Calculating the economic impact of a disaster would include many indirect costs, such as wage loss and decreased market supply. So the total economic loss may not be directly determined, but there is some macroeconomic research that can help explain further damage costs.

### Overview of Interface

---

The index.html file contains a frame work for a form that submits to a flask app, /n
as well as embedded Tableau tables. This stage of EDA informed our perspective on /n
damages caused by a storm. We noted that it was possible for a storm to hit an /n
unpopulated zip code, or a less insured zip code, or a zip code that costs more to /n
fix: variation in property market value, material costs, insured for the type /n
of storm, etc. From this understanding we moved to create a ratio of past payouts /n
per affected zip codes. This was done with FEMA data, as other data tended to be /n
propriety from a paid source. You can visually see this relationship in the embedded /n
tables.

The form then sends the zip code, and timecode information to a function that /n
returns a series of data frames.

## ###Challenges:

-API documentation was deprecated or turned into a premium (paid) service
-Zillow aggregate data was no longer available
-Using DASH inside of a Flask app is nuanced
-The format of Plot.ly inside of DASH required manipulating the returned DataFrames
