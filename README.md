## Problem Statement

During a disaster, it is important to model and estimate the potential or forecasted effect of the event, including the projected/forecasted damage.

Existing indicators of forecasted damage include number of structures within the affected area, number of people in the area, number of households, demographics of the impacted population, etc. This project will add an additional indicator: the value of the properties in the affected area.
